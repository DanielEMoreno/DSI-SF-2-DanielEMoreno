The reviews of a videogame very indirectly effect it's overall success. With more poblissity surrounding the videogame based on the overall summation of it's reviews and how users are reacting to the gameplay experience it definetly has an effect on how many people see the videogame and make a judgement as to whether or not they want to buy the videogame, based on those reviews.\n",

With columns encompassing multiple different metrics about the review itself, it is only a representation of the reviewer's attitude toward the videogame at that point in time. To create a metric of success given the data I take the amount of hours the user has played thus far (as of 9/24/216) compared to the time they played the game when the reviewer posted their review, it potentially could provide for a relationship between the valence of the review and the amount of time they play the videogame following the review.

    "After ruling out the relationship between sentiment and the amount of additional  hours a reviewer has played the game they reviewed, there must be a better reason for why there is such an imbalence of classes. Investigating this with a Naive Bayes classifier pretty much a perfect fit. The classifier is fast to use, only requiring one pass over the data. In some cases it is unbeneficial to use Naive Bayes as it assumes independance of all observations. This is not an issue when it comes to classifying the video  game reviews as they are independent of one another -- It seems highly unlikely that someone would post a review solely because of another person's review, there is definetly influence however that comes from the reviewer reading other reviews."
